# horror-movie-kill-count-analysis
Short study looking into 20 years of horror films (from 2005-2025), analyzing their kill counts to observe trends over time. With intent to determine statistical significance of kill counts and release years.

As a fun side project, I wanted to look into the last 20 years of horror, using data from the Dead Meat Youtube Channel in their series Kill Count. Using these kill counts, I put the data into an easily readable spreadsheet form and exported that as a csv (attached in the repo as "horror_movie_data.csv" then analyzed it as a dataframe in a python jupyter notebook. 

While unconvential and not a large sample of data, the analysis gave a hint to the trends (or lack thereof) of violence and the last 20 years of horror.

Sample from the written study:

**Abstract**

Film as a media has been present in culture worldwide for hundreds of years, with horror originating in the
mid 1890s. As with everything, horror films have evolved and adapted with mainstream tastes, one of these
components being the portrayal of violence. This review looks at kill counts, as counted by the Dead Meat
YouTube channel in their YouTube series Kill Count, a popular web series that analyzes and counts deaths in
horror movies ranging from cult classics to new releases. Throughout this review, descriptive and statistical
analyses were performed, looking at total kill counts by release year, as well as breaking down kill counts by
gender. Descriptive statistics were used to identify trends, supported by a Pearson correlation coefficient test
to assess statistical significance. Despite visible peaks in certain years (2007, 2012, 2019), the results did not
indicate a statistically significant correlation between release year and kill counts (with p-values ranging from
0.098 to 0.661). Although the demographic of women showed the strongest linear relationship, it remained
weak and statistically insignificant. The statistical test also resulted in a linearity coefficient (0.216, 0.213,
0.380, 0.105), concluding that there was a weak linear relationship between release year and kill counts for
the four observed demographics (total kill count, male kill count, female kill count, and other(s) kill count.
Ultimately, while descriptive trends suggest fluctuations in on-screen violence, statistical analysis does not
support a clear upward trend in kill counts over the past two decades.
